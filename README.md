# Halloween4.1
Create the external style sheet for the home page from the main.css file that’s in the styles 
folder. This file is currently blank. Set the default font for the document to a sans-serif font. 
Adjust the font sizes for all of the headings. In addition, format the first letter of the first 
heading in the main content so it’s larger than the other letters in the heading. In the header, float the image to the left and indent both headings. In addition, change the 
color of the first heading to orange, italicize it, and add a black shadow. Format the links so they’re displayed in boldfaced orange whether or not they’ve been 
visited. If a link has the focus or the mouse is hovering over it, though, it should be 
displayed in green.
